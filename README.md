# NTU-canteen-recommender
Made as a part of a university project, this code is used to recommend the canteens to the user based on input distance and ratings. The code makes use of pygame for the interface and is terminal based.  
  
One can view the picture of the canteens, obtain user ratings about it, input location by just clicking on the map(displayed in pygame) and get the distance of all the major canteens present in the Nanyang Technological University.  
  
The code even provides the bus routes based on the present location, sorts the canteens based on distance and ratings and provides features for zooming in and out of the picture of the canteen for more clarity.  
  
The cusisines available in each canteen are also available and the user can give his own ratings to the respective canteen as well, which is permanently stored.
